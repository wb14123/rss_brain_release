I’m always searching for new platformers, I’ve gone through all the big names across the years and many smaller ones too, but if you’d asked me last month who Kao was, I couldn’t have told you. Like many mascots, Kao fell into obscurity but thanks to Tate Multimedia’s surprise reboot, he’s back in fighting form with a fresh story. Going hands-on with a preview build, it’s pretty easy but so far, I’m enjoying what I’ve seen.</p><section data-transform="mobile-ad-break"></section><p>Kao’s journey kicks off with a familiar premise, rescuing family members who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Both his sister and father are missing, while an unknown foe called the Eternal Warrior’s begun corrupting the world with a dark power. Nothing that’d be amiss in a Saturday morning cartoon. Starting off on Hopalloo Island, a land that’s basically Australia, this preview had me explore two worlds, including the more tropical Hungry Jungle. Both locations serve as hubs filled with collectibles, unlocking new levels once you’ve found enough runes. </p><section data-transform="slideshow" data-slug="kao-the-kangaroo-april-2022-screenshots" data-value="kao-the-kangaroo-april-2022-screenshots" data-type="slug" data-caption=""></section><p>Unsurprisingly, Kao’s investigation isn’t welcomed by this Eternal Warrior but he’s not alone. Assisting him is his father’s old punching gloves, both imbued with a strange power. Giving Kao enhanced abilities beyond your standard jabs and combos, he can strike deadly finishing blows once his attack gauge is charged, filled by hitting enemies in quick succession. Better still, these gloves can store three elemental charges at once – I’ve only unlocked fire so far - used it to clear obstacles like spider webs, burning them down with a simple hit. Otherwise, more defensive players can throw objects from range or use his dodge roll, which doubles up as an attack. </p><section data-transform="object-feedback"></section><section data-transform="quoteBox">It all felt rather easy, and there are no difficulty settings either.</section><p>Kao’s got moves and there’s considerable enemy variety to keep battles interesting. Boss fights throw a few new tricks at you, like the first boss (Terror) leaving a trail of fire behind him as he charges you but otherwise, it all felt rather easy, and there’s no difficulty settings either. During this preview, I only died twice, each death occurring before I’d found extra heart pieces to increase Kao’s health. You can’t just stand there wailing on enemies, that dodge roll is a lifesaver against groups, but don’t expect much of a challenge </p><section data-transform="ignvideo" data-slug="kao-the-kangaroo-2022-official-announcement-trailer" data-loop=""></section><p>Still, if all you’re after is a straightforward platformer, Kao’s proving to be a solid choice. Gameplay is fun, there’s a light-hearted story with a good sense of humour, and a colourful presentation that’s visually appealing. It could do with less outdated pop culture references though, jokes like “taking an arrow to the knee” or “it’s clobberin time!” will likely fly over most kids’ heads, but at least that’s infrequent </p><p>Platforming was what sold Kao for me, going beyond the basics after the first world. Climbing across vines using Kao’s ears is silly fun, you can channel your inner Spider-Man by swinging across floating hooks with a grapple ability, while those elemental abilities are creatively used. One memorable level had me running away from an enemy rolling towards Kao on a giant log, invoking memories of Crash Bandicoot’s famous Boulder Dash and Sonic Adventure’s whale chase. </p><section data-transform="quoteBox">Most levels hide rewards like extra lives, heart pieces, or treasure chests packed with coins.</section><p>Levels are packed with hidden secrets too, encouraging you to explore. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve tried checking behind waterfalls in games and if you’re the same, I’ve got excellent news. Most levels hide rewards like extra lives, heart pieces, or treasure chests packed with ducats (coins), using the latter to buy the other two in each hub world’s shop. You can customise Kao’s appearance with new clothes, even giving him a retro inspired look. Just be warned, Kao’s most certainly a collecthaon. </p><section data-transform="slideshow" data-slug="kao-the-kangaroo-2022-screenshots" data-value="kao-the-kangaroo-2022-screenshots" data-type="slug" data-caption=""></section><p>Similar to Donkey Kong Country, every level contains three hidden letters that spell KAO found through thorough exploration, which can be easily missed. Diamonds are scattered about too, while some enemies drop scrolls, offering new lore for the Kaopedia. I can see it’s meant to incentivise replaying levels but scrolls aside, these items don’t offer any practical reward beyond completionist bragging rights. Only runes are essential, so if the thought of another collecting marathon worries you, fear not, everything else is optional.</p><p>Despite this lack of challenge, I had great fun with Kao the Kangaroo. Powerful boxing gloves excluded, it doesn’t rely on weird gimmicks to stand out, yet despite cruising through combat, I never felt bored. We’ve got is a refreshingly straightforward platformer which scratches a nostalgic itch, one that makes no secret of its influences.  What I’ve seen looks promising and I’m looking forward to the full release.</p></section>]]></content:encoded><media:content height="720" width="1280" type="image/jpeg" url="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/20/kaokangaroo-blogroll-1650496851022.jpg" /><dc:creator>Ryan McCaffrey</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Halo: The TV Series Episode 5 Review - "Reckoning"]]></title><link>https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-tv-ep5-review</link><description><![CDATA[Halo's fifth episode doesn't address one of the series' lingering flaws, but it does deliver a thrilling battle sequence that will please fans of the games.

If you need a refresher on where we left off, here&#39;s </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-tv-ep4-review">our review of Episode 4</a><em>.</em></p><section data-transform="mobile-ad-break"></section><section data-transform="divider"></section><p>Halo laid out its strengths and weaknesses in its first episode, and not a lot has changed in that regard over the past month. This show succeeds in taking a slightly different and more character-driven path with the source material. On the other hand, the series has come up a bit lacking in the action and spectacle department, and there&#39;s the matter of that pesky Hwan Ha/Soren subplot. The good news is that one of those two flaws is addressed in Episode 5.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, that aforementioned subplot is no more engaging in this episode than it has been for the past several weeks. The complaint is always the same: Kwan Ha no longer feels like a particularly necessary or compelling character now that her story has diverged from Master Chief&#39;s. The series continues to hint that eventually their paths will cross again, but that&#39;s hardly enoguh to justify all the screen time being devoted to Kwan and Soren goofing around in the desert. Not to sound like a broken record, but at some point the show really needs to establish why Kwan&#39;s arc matters and why the civil war on Madrigal is relevant to the larger UNSC/Covenant conflict.</p><section data-transform="object-feedback"></section><section data-transform="slideshow" data-slug="halo-the-series-gallery" data-value="halo-the-series-gallery" data-type="slug" data-caption=""></section><p>The focus on those two is all the more frustrating in Episode 5 because it takes up valuable storytelling space that could be better directed elsewhere. This is the first episode since the premiere to devote much attention to Danny Sapani&#39;s Captain Keyes and his dysfunctional family dynamic. What we do get this week is a welcome addition to the mix, but it&#39;s hard not to want a little more.</p><p>Episode 5 does add some intriguing new layers to Captain Keyes and his relationships with both Miranda and Master Chief. There&#39;s a clear sense that he&#39;s not quite the neutral third party in the cold war between Miranda and Dr. Halsey that he&#39;d like to appear to be. We see that he&#39;s all too willing to manipulate his daughter&#39;s career for his own ends, even if he ostensibly has her best interests at heart. There&#39;s also plenty to pick apart in Keyes&#39; conversation with John where he promsies to &quot;look into&quot; Halsey&#39;s shady behavior. Is he being honest and forthright there, or is he merely stalling for time because he knows his own hands are dirty? Hopefully that&#39;s a question that will remain at the forefront in the latter half of the season.</p><p><section data-transform="poll" data-id="b8b6986a-f2a3-4a9a-a4d7-e08eb54d63ce"></section></p><p>For all the strengths of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-tv-series-premiere-review">Halo series premiere</a>, that episode didn&#39;t do the best job of nailing the larger-than-life action of the games. Expensive though this show may be, it&#39;s not quite up to the task of depicting the Covenant creatures and tech and making those elements feel like a seamless part of the live-action environment. The big action sequence in Episode 1 certainly echoed the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-single-player-campaign-review-xbox-series-x-xbox-one-pc">Halo games</a> through the use of first-person perspective and those familiar weapons, but the exciting, visceral nature of actually playing Halo was lost.</p><p>Thankfully, Episode 5 does a far better job at delivering that trademark Halo spectacle. That&#39;s not to say the special effects are necessarily &quot;better&quot; than they were in the pilot – the Covenant characters are still trapped in the CGI Uncanny Valley, and that&#39;s probably something fans will just have to acclimate to over the course of the show. The difference is more in the scale of the action: this time around, we&#39;re not simply watching a team of Spartans gun down a Covenant platoon, but a multi-pronged assault involving both ground and aerial combatants. It&#39;s much easier to ignore the sometimes-dodgy CGI and simply enjoy the chaos. This sequence, unlike the one in the pilot, truly does feel like a Halo game come to life.</p><section data-transform="ignvideo" data-slug="halo-where-did-the-artifact-come-from-canon-fodder" data-loop=""></section><p>It helps that the stakes are much clearer and more immediate, as well. Master Chief and his allies are much more on the defensive this time. Plus, there&#39;s the question of how John and Kai will each react to fighting their first real battle without their emotion-inhibiors installed. Not well, it seems. Far from being the unstoppable super-soldiers their creator intended, Kai is paralyzed by the first pangs of fear she&#39;s probably felt in her adult life, and John blows the entire mission in order to save her. This series has made a smart choice in zeroing in on the conflict between conditioning and free will with the Spartans, and that pays off handsomely in Episode 5&#39;s gloomy climax.   </p></section>]]></content:encoded><media:content height="674" width="1199" type="image/jpeg" url="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/20/halo-ver6-xlg-1650487615458.jpg" /><dc:creator>JMBurge$$</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lost Ark Is the Latest Game To Get a Battle Pass]]></title><link>https://www.ign.com/articles/lost-ark-is-the-latest-game-to-get-a-battle-pass</link><description><![CDATA[Lost Ark's rumoured Battle Pass is now official and already available.]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 12:40:48 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">b1963304-a9c8-4bfb-ad81-1a30d14af3a0</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<section class="article-page"><p>Lost Ark&#39;s rumoured Battle Pass is now official and already available.</p><section data-transform="mobile-ad-break"></section><p>Amazon Games confirmed in <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-gb/news/articles/april-2022-release-notes">a blog post</a> that the Ark Pass would be included in the action-RPG as part of the April update that released today.</p><p>The Battle Pass works in the same way as Fortnite&#39;s or Call of Duty&#39;s: players will progress through levels for different rewards by simply playing the game or, in some cases, completing specific objectives.</p><section data-transform="ignvideo" data-slug="lost-ark-13-essential-things-to-know-when-you-reach-level-50" data-loop=""></section><p>The regular Ark Pass is free and grants several rewards across 30 levels including a mount, pirate coins, and honing material selection chests.</p><p>Two other versions of the pass are available at an additional cost.

It would probably be a great idea to tell the story of how The Godfather was made (like the upcoming Barry Levinson movie<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-godfather-oscar-isaac-francis-ford-coppola-jake-gyllenhaal-robert-evans"> <u>Francis</u></a> is doing). The Offer, bizarrely, tries to do both, via homages galore, and via head-scratching dramatizations that stray well past creative license and end up somewhere in the realm of fan fiction. Then again, even if the Paramount+ series were sold as a gangster fantasy, it would still be an utterly baffling watch, with a first episode so scattershot and uninteresting that even the exponential improvements in the second and third don’t feel worth the time.</p><p>The era of “trust me, it gets better” TV recommendations has finally met its match.</p><section data-transform="slideshow" data-slug="every-exclusive-movie-and-tv-series-coming-to-paramount" data-value="every-exclusive-movie-and-tv-series-coming-to-paramount" data-type="slug" data-caption=""></section><section data-transform="object-feedback"></section><p>The series is nominally about the making of The Godfather, but what it’s really about is the strange self-mythology of producer Al Ruddy (Miles Teller), who executive produced the show, and upon whose <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/04/the-offer-facts-the-godfather-production-peter-bart-1235001960/amp/"><u>oft-challenged recollections</u></a> the story is based. It would be one thing — one fascinating thing, at that — if The Offer actually felt like a work of unhinged ego, since it so often follows a super-producer with magical charm, who jumps nearly every production hurdle with the power of words. The result, however, is about as tensionless as HBO’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/21/entourage-season-7-review"><u>Entourage</u></a>, in which pretty-boy actor Vincent Chase initially doesn’t get the role he wants, but a few scenes later, he inevitably does. The difference is that Entourage was far more focused, and had something resembling a sense of time and place.</p><p>The first episode, titled “A Seat at the Table,” is directed by Dexter Fletcher, runs over an hour, and evokes the distinct feeling of watching something assembled by machines. It serves to introduce several characters key to The Godfather’s making — Rudy, studio executive Bob Evans (Matthew Goode), author and screenwriter Mario Puzo (Patrick Gallo), and mafia antagonist Joe Colombo (Giovanni Ribisi) — but it lurches forward without a discernible narrative, even when it returns to any one of their stories. Puzo, for instance, has the idea to write The Godfather in one scene, has effortlessly written it in the next, and reaps the benefits of its smashing success in the scene after that; Rudy, similarly, gets his foot in the door of Hollywood just as quickly and begins climbing its ladder at lightning speed, but no two of their scenes are connected by anything other than their own presence.</p><section data-transform="poll" data-id="7a6e2707-3052-4aad-934d-ae6a074173e6"></section><p>The closest thing “A Seat at the Table” has to a through line is the story of Ribisi’s sweaty, scowling Colombo, who takes offense to Puzo’s novel and eventually to the film’s production, though he shows up too infrequently to seem like a meaningful part of the episode. Rather than a narrative, the first chapter feels like a scattered rundown of backstory elements that, in any sensible production, would be truncated to a montage or a few lines of exposition, instead of being stretched out over what appears to be several years before the story actually begins (the show immediately feels like it should have been a movie instead). Its sense of time, or lack thereof, is matched by a similarly slapdash sense of place, reducing even early ’70s Hollywood parties to stilted sequences of muted chatter without any real panache — even when Rudy meets the rich, eccentric Evans for the first time at an opulent mansion, or when he meets his captivating, outspoken future wife, Francoise Glazer (Nora Arnezeder). Goode is as chaotically energetic as a figure like Evans deserves, but he’s dragged through a series that looks and feels like someone sucked all the visual energy out of Boogie Nights.</p><p>Not only does the first episode churn out an array of disconnected, clinical factoids, it does so amidst nearly ceaseless references to The Godfather while trying to mold itself off Francis Ford Coppola’s masterpiece. The opening shot pays homage to The Godfather Part II. The opening line even quotes the first film, and there’s a shot that lingers on a toilet in an Italian restaurant, as if to nudge you in the ribs and whisper “Remember that far superior scene?” Yet The Offer has little interest in recreating The Godfather’s narrative in anything but a superficial sense. It doesn’t play with light or shadow the way The Godfather’s cinematographer Gordon Willis did, despite similar motifs recurring throughout the show. Its shots rarely linger, and fail to unearth what lies beneath the surface of any character (Rudy’s go-getter secretary Bettye McCartt is the exception, but only because actress Juno Temple is so adept at playfully navigating a world of suits while alternatingly hiding and displaying the character’s intellect). The show simply zips from scene to scene, always in a hurry to go nowhere in particular.</p><section data-transform="quoteBox">The Offer&#39;s hyperbolic dramatizations are distinctly undramatic.</section><p>The two subsequent premiere episodes — directed by Fletcher and Adam Arkin respectively — feel less haphazard in their construction, but they also suffer from near constant Easter Egg-ing. A real-life producer being left a bloody “message” in his bed recalls a similar scene in The Godfather, and while this instance is a fictional creation of the series, it isn’t re-woven into the story of how the movie came to be. It’s one of a litany of references that exists only to evoke empty nostalgia, rather than to string together a relationship between fact and fiction — despite delightful (albeit minor) subplots about how Puzo and Coppola (Dan Fogler) conceived several memorable scenes.</p><p>Fogler, who stars in the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review"> <u>Fantastic Beasts</u></a> movies, appears to have carved out a very specific niche as the warmest and most human actor in otherwise abysmal productions. His Coppola is a treat (as is Burn Gorman’s cartoonish Austrian industrialist Charles Bluhdorn, albeit for different reasons), but the buck stops there. Arnezeder shines in her role as Francoise, arriving with an immediate and alluring presence and maintaining it through glances that search for answers to whatever Rudy might be hiding — he doesn’t let her in on the tumultuous goings on of the movie’s production — but even her distinctly Godfather-esque story, of a wife pushed further and further into the margins by her husband’s business, ends up just as tensionless as Rudy’s other scenes, since most of their marital problems are smoothed over with a mere snap of his fingers (offering Teller little to work with in the process too).</p><section data-transform="ignvideo" data-slug="the-offer-official-trailer" data-loop=""></section><p>Apart from the creative and logistical tensions of getting The Godfather approved at Paramount, the show’s major plot is spun from real-world anecdotes about Colombo and other mafiosos initially objecting to the film, which The Offer tries to turn into its own sprawling gangster saga. Its hyperbolic dramatizations, however, are distinctly undramatic, and are actually less interesting than some of the real events that unfolded (for instance, the show tries to reframe Colombo’s founding of the Italian-American Civil Rights League as a result of The Godfather’s production, rather than the FBI’s harassment of his son, but in the process, it creates a version of the infamous gangster who seems far less dedicated and compelling). Even if one were to ignore reality, The Offer’s version of events rarely warrants more than a shrug or a chuckle. Despite roping in dangerous mobsters to inexplicably target Rudy, it makes the making of The Godfather feel like a piece of cake, given how easily he solves every problem. </p><p>The show’s indecisive relationship to reality is best exemplified by its casting. Where Fogler captures the essence of Coppola — his cadence, his passion, his irritability — without veering too far into impersonation, The Offer’s other, more well-known personalities are flung so far in opposite directions as to be irreconcilable. Its version of Frank Sinatra (Frank John Hughes), who objected to the character of Johnny Fontane, is so un-Sinatra-like in look, stature, presence, and voice that when he’s introduced, your eyes are likely to be drawn by the more charismatic extra seated beside him (this is also function of how thoughtlessly the scene is lit and framed). Meanwhile, the series’ Al Pacino — Anthony Ippolito doing a rather caricatured impression — looks and sounds so much like a parody of Michael Corleone (rather than capturing the spirit of a young Pacino behind the scenes) that he comes off less like a real person, and more like an uncanny deep-fake programmed from archival footage (Ribisi is just as caricatured as Colombo and sounds incomprehensible; it’s like he swallowed a frog).</p><section data-transform="slideshow" data-slug="every-cancelled-and-ending-tv-show-announced-in-2022" data-value="every-cancelled-and-ending-tv-show-announced-in-2022" data-type="slug" data-caption=""></section><p>By the time the third episode comes to a close, even the show’s vaguely established notions of conflict seem to have been resolved. Meanwhile, the various problems looming in the characters’ futures are even more disconnected from one another than was previously the case. What does The Offer appear to promise in its remaining seven chapters? If the marginally more cohesive second and third episodes are anything to go by, one answer is borderline competence. Another is the sibling-like banter between Puzo and Coppola that, while devoid of much real artistic psychology beyond recalling familiar scenes, proves to be light and entertaining enough. However, the overarching answer appears to be little more than occasionally satisfying a few behind-the-scenes curiosities, which can just as easily be read on Wikipedia, and are probably more engaging that way as it is.</p><section data-transform="quoteBox">Ten-part series The Offer is off to a disastrous start.</section><p>As for the actual “drama” in The Offer’s dramatizations: the show’s foundation is unnervingly rickety. It’s ready to collapse at a moment’s notice, perhaps the next time an artist or gangster with their own convictions and opinions is swiftly swayed by a mere sentence or two from Rudy, rather than undergoing a meaningful, human change.</p></section>]]></content:encoded><media:content height="675" width="1200" type="image/jpeg" url="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/18/the-offer-blogroll-1650306814072.jpg" /><dc:creator>Alex Stedman</dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kingsman Almost Got a Trailer That Included All Six James Bond Actors]]></title><link>https://www.ign.com/articles/kingsman-almost-had-a-trailer-with-all-six-james-bond-actors</link><description><![CDATA[Kingsman creator Mark Millar has revealed that the spy spoof almost got a trailer featuring all six James Bond actors.]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">656c5b93-c315-4370-ad0f-375a7867f082</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<section class="article-page"><p>Spy comedy <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-secret-service">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a> almost got all six James Bond actors together for a trailer that would see them pass the baton to the new spy series.</p><section data-transform="mobile-ad-break"></section><p>During an interview with <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-james-bond-a-z-podcast/id1547415802">The James Bond A-Z Podcast</a>, creator Mark Millar revealed that Kingsman almost had a teaser trailer featuring all six 007s, and it only fell apart due to the very first.</p><p>“Matthew Vaughan who directed Kingsman had this really cool idea, when Sean Connery was still alive, and Roger Moore was still alive,” he said. “His idea was to do a promotional teaser for Kingsman where you had all the previous Bonds together, all having a toast around the table.

After almost three years, the highly-anticipated sequel will finally be receiving a beta next week. Recently, developers behind the game have expressed their displeasure with its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-diablo-4-delayed">lengthy development</a>. </p><section data-transform="mobile-ad-break"></section><p>In an interview with <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2022/04/overwatch-2-interview-devs-geoff-goodman-brandon-brennan">USA Today</a>, lead hero designer Geoff Goodman detailed how the team had a plan in place for the development of Overwatch 2. </p><p>“We talked about it, way back,” he said. “We talked about how we were going to, on the production side, develop Overwatch 2 alongside Overwatch.” </p><p>Unfortunately, this plan was derailed by the game’s many delays. </p><section data-transform="slideshow" data-slug="activision-blizzard-deal-compared-to-other-major-acquisitions" data-value="activision-blizzard-deal-compared-to-other-major-acquisitions" data-type="slug" data-caption=""></section><p>“I think the whole team was kind of upset and annoyed a bit with the timing of how everything got delayed. Goodman added, “There were a lot of reasons for it, it wasn’t just one thing.” </p><p>According to the interview, these delays came from production costs.</p><p>“It is a pretty constant topic for everything in the game, actually, production costs,” Goodman said. &quot;I mean, Blizzard is not really a studio that is shackled to dates but that doesn’t mean we’re completely free from all concerns of production costs and time.”</p><section data-transform="object-feedback"></section><p>Goodman says the hardest part of the delays was not being able to share ideas with the players. “It’s hard for us to have these ideas that we want to get out there, big changes, and we’ve sort’ve locked ourselves away a little bit.” </p><p>Goodman also mentioned how excited the team is to be once again putting out new content for players to enjoy such as a reworked Orisa and the game’s new PvE content. </p><p>Overwatch 2 comes at a time when Activision Blizzard is battling several controversies, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-software-qa-workers-strike-union">unionization</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-timeline-the-story-so-far">ongoing lawsuits</a>.  It is currently set to release on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch, with the closed PVP beta available on PC on April 26. The full game does not yet have a firm release date, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pvp-pve-separate-release-beta-april">though with PvE and PvP being split</a>, the competitive mode figures out to be sooner than the cooperative mode. </p><p>&quot;I’m ready for us to rise above what’s happened and grow from it, don’t turn the corner and turn a blind eye to it, just be better,&quot; senior hero design Brandon Brennan says. &quot;Get these games into the player’s hands and get them to be excited about something from us for once. I do think we’re approaching that moment, it at least feels that way to me.&quot;  </p><section data-transform="ignvideo" data-slug="overwatch-2-sojourn-gameplay-trailer" data-loop=""></section><p></p><section data-transform="divider"></section><p><em>Brendn Bell is a freelance writer for IGN</em></p></section>]]></content:encoded><media:content height="1080" width="1920" type="image/jpeg" url="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/20/overwatch-2-1650490734684.jpg" /><dc:creator>Kat Bailey</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
